# Hello-World
This is what is done in any new language you want to learn or new program being used

My name is Angel Ocampo and this is my first time using Github. It was somewhat difficult to find all the buttoms I was trying to look for.
Apperently I didn't make any changes when I did so it wont let me pull request.
